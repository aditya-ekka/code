Dennis Ritchie 1971-73
c: structured-oriented programming lang
   general purpose lang
.PROCEDURAL LANGUAGE? a type of prog lang that follows a sequential, step-by-step approach to solve problems.
.   procedural prog is a sub class of IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING, which includes block and scope concepts.
.c supports assembly language

BASIC DATA TYPES SUPORTED IN C PROG?
.int .char .float .double .void

TOKENS IN C?
identifiers or smallest single uint in a prog tha is meaningful to compiler.
# KEYWORD:  predefined or reserved words; 32 keywords in C
# IDENTFIERS:  user-defined names composed with letters, numbers, _ (but can't start with no)
# CONSTANTS:  normal variables that cant be modified in program once they are defined.
# STRINGS:  array of characters that ennds with a null character ('\0')
# SPECIAL SYMBOLS:  # = , * ; []
# OPERATORS:  symbols that trigger an action when they are applied to any variable. Unary, Binary, and Ternary operators.

what is SCOPE OF VARIABLE?
.Local variable: inside a given fn or block
.Global variable: out of all fn globally inside the program
.Formal variable: in-function parameter

what are PREPROCESSOR DIRECTIVES ?
built-in predefined functions or macros that act as directive to the compiler and are executed before the prog execution
.main types of preprocessor directives are : Macros, file inclusion, conditional compilation, and other directives like #undef, #pragma, etc.

c source code -> preprocessor directives execution -> compiler -> (object code) -> linker -> executable code

use of STATIC variables ?
.to preserve data values b/w fn calls even after they are out of their scope.
.preserve their value in their scope and they can be used again in the program without initializing again.
.have an initial value assigned to 0 without initialization.

what is the difference b/w MALLOC() and CALLOC() ?
